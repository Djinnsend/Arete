My project, as a database driven website, aims to make the research and information finding for Volunteering Oppurtunities, much more 
convenient or easy. With my project, organization's will be able to post volunteering oppurtunities and
interested persons would be able to subscribe to our service and be able to see all volunteering chances
as well as links to apply. Thus my users are organizations that host or represent volunteering oppurtunities
 as well as interested applicants.
 
 The key functionalities:
+  ALLOWING EASY STORAGE OF ALL INFORMATION WITH REGARDS TO VOLUNTEERING
  OPPORTUNITIES , IN A PUBLIC DOMAIN.
+ EASE OF THE STRESS AND DIFFICULTY THAT INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS HAVE IN FINDING INFORMATION
  ABOUT VOLUNTEERING OPPORTUNITIES.
